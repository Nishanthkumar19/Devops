right now i will upload my project zip file. and i will tell my project problem statement. so i am working on full stack project of expiration market place which deals with products in a market or shop has expiry date and once the expiration of a product nears we dont know when it is going to expire or how many days and we cant see one by one by records for all the products so .this expiration market place helps to alert or remind what are the products which are nearing to expiration and days left or months left so that it will be easy for the client to know the time duration of the product. And for example a product has a expiration of 6 months and already 4 months over and in the another 2 months a new product is being installed of same product .so at that time it will be difficult for them to identfy which is new and which is old . for that purpose also we use this expiration market place by having a an seperate product id so that we can differentiate them .
